 <h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
    <p >Hello! My name is Komal. I’m working toward becoming a software developer because I love technology and how it can solve real-world problems. I enjoy learning about programming and improving my skills step by step.<br> In my free time, I like to create simple and beautiful web pages. I’m a beginner in web development. So I started learning how to make websites using HTML and CSS. It helps me practice design, be creative, and have fun while learning. This website is part of my learning journey, and I’m excited to grow and improve every day. <br>I believe that every small project I make brings me closer to my dream. I'm always curious and open to learning new things—whether it’s a new programming language, tool, or idea. z</p>
